\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Predefined event names.

An \doxylink{class_event}{Event} is an important occurrence in your app that you want to measure. You can report up to 500 different types of Events per app and you can associate up to 25 unique parameters with each \doxylink{class_event}{Event} type. Some common events are suggested below, but you may also choose to specify custom \doxylink{class_event}{Event} types that are associated with your specific app. Each event type is identified by a unique name. \doxylink{class_event}{Event} names can be up to 40 characters long, may only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores ("{}\+\_\+"{}), and must start with an alphabetic character. The "{}firebase\+\_\+"{}, "{}google\+\_\+"{}, and "{}ga\+\_\+"{} prefixes are reserved and should not be used.
