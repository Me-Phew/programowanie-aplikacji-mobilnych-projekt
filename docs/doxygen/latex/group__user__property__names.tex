Predefined user property names.

A User\+Property is an attribute that describes the app-\/user. By supplying User\+Properties, you can later analyze different behaviors of various segments of your userbase. You may supply up to 25 unique User\+Properties per app, and you can use the name and value of your choosing for each one. User\+Property names can be up to 24 characters long, may only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores ("{}\+\_\+"{}), and must start with an alphabetic character. User\+Property values can be up to 36 characters long. The "{}firebase\+\_\+"{}, "{}google\+\_\+"{}, and "{}ga\+\_\+"{} prefixes are reserved and should not be used.
